# Dark Matter Clustering

Friends of Friends is a piece of cosmological simulation analysis software written as part of a university project in C. It's been written entirely in C (so far) and there are eventual plans to port this code to [Julia 1.8](https://julialang.org/downloads/) for ease of development across GPU Clusters.

The makefile currently exists within the /src folder, until I can figure out how to move it back into the main folder. The data required to run the simulation is not available for public release (from my knowledge).

Enjoy and remember, faster is better in the wild west ðŸ¤
